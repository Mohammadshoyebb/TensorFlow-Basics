# TensorFlow Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating various functionalities of TensorFlow in Python. Below is a structured overview of the code:

## Basic Operations
- Addition and multiplication of tensors using TensorFlow.
- Session-based execution to compute results.

## Tensor Creation
- Creation of tensors with specific values like ones, zeros, identity matrices, and random values.
- Generating tensors with ranges and different data types.

## Matrix Operations
- Basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Reshaping tensors and computing dot products using multiple methods.

## Advanced Features
- Utilization of TensorFlow's softmax activation function.
- Summation and conversion of vectors into tensors.
- Indexing and slicing tensors for specific elements.

## Device Handling
- Detection of the device (GPU, CPU, TPU) used by TensorFlow for computation.

## Variable Management
- Management of TensorFlow variables, including creation, assignment, and manipulation.
- Definition and evaluation of functions using TensorFlow variables.

## Execution
To execute these examples, ensure TensorFlow is installed (`pip install tensorflow`). Each script demonstrates various TensorFlow functionalities, from fundamental tensor operations to advanced matrix manipulations and device utilization.

For detailed implementation, refer to the corresponding Python scripts in this repository.
